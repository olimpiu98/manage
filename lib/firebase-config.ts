// This file is for reference only - you need to update your Firebase security rules in the Firebase console

/*
Step-by-step instructions to fix the Firebase permission error:

1. Go to the Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Firestore Database"
4. Click on the "Rules" tab at the top
5. Replace ALL the existing rules with the following:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

6. Click the "Publish" button to save the changes
7. Wait a few moments for the rules to propagate (usually takes less than a minute)
8. Refresh your application

This will allow unrestricted access to your database, which is useful for development.
