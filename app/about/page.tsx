        <p className="text">
          Anatolion Guild was formed by a group of friends who shared a passion for MMORPGs and a vision to
          create a community that values both competitive excellence and supportive camaraderie.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          Named after the ancient region of Anatolia, a crossroads of civilizations, our guild embraces diversity and
          brings together players from all walks of life. We've grown from a small group of friends to a thriving
          community of dedicated players.
        </p>
