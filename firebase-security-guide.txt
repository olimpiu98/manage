How to Update Firebase Security Rules:

1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Firestore Database"
4. Click on the "Rules" tab at the top
5. Replace ALL the existing rules with the following:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read and write access to all documents for all users
    // IMPORTANT: This is a temporary solution for debugging
    // You should restrict this once the app is working
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

6. Click the "Publish" button to save the changes
7. Wait a few moments for the rules to propagate (usually takes less than a minute)
8. Test your application again - the error should be resolved

IMPORTANT: Once your application is working correctly, you should update the rules to be more secure:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to all documents for all users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Only allow write access to authenticated users
    match /parties/{partyId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /members/{memberId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /events/{eventId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

These rules will:
- Allow anyone to read data (view parties, members, events)
- Only allow authenticated users to write data (create, update, delete)

This is a good balance between security and functionality for your app.
If you need more granular control, you can further restrict write operations
based on user roles or document ownership.
